## Why do we need DI Containers?

Dependency injection (DI) containers are used in dependency injection to manage the dependencies between objects in a software application. DI containers provide several benefits, including:

-Reduced tight coupling: DI containers can help reduce the tight coupling between different parts of the code by managing the dependencies between objects. This can make the code more flexible and easier to maintain and extend.
-Improved code design: DI containers can help enforce good design principles, such as the separation of concerns and the single responsibility principle, by enforcing rules about how objects should be created and managed.
-Easier testing: DI containers can make it easier to test the different parts of an application in isolation by allowing mock dependencies to be injected into the objects being tested.
-Improved flexibility: DI containers can make it easier to swap out different implementations of a dependency, or to add new dependencies, without having to make changes to the code that uses the dependency.

Overall, DI containers can make it easier to develop, test, and maintain complex software applications that use dependency injection.

## Example DI

Here is an example of how dependency injection (DI) can be used in a TypeScript application:
```
// CustomerService depends on the Logger service
class CustomerService {
  constructor(private logger: Logger) {}

  public saveCustomer(customer: Customer) {
    this.logger.log(`Saving customer: ${customer.name}`);
    // Save the customer to the database
  }
}

// Logger service
class Logger {
  public log(message: string) {
    console.log(message);
  }
}

// Customer class
class Customer {
  public name: string;
}

// Create an instance of the CustomerService and inject the Logger service
const customerService = new CustomerService(new Logger());

// Use the customer service to save a customer
const customer = new Customer();
customer.name = 'John Doe';
customerService.saveCustomer(customer);
```

In this example, the CustomerService class depends on the Logger service to log messages. When an instance of CustomerService is created, it is provided with an instance of Logger through the constructor. This allows the CustomerService to use the Logger to log messages without having to create the Logger itself. This makes the code more flexible and easier to test, as the CustomerService can be provided with a mock Logger when it is being tested.

## Example DI Containers

```
// CustomerService depends on the Logger service
class CustomerService {
  constructor(private logger: Logger) {}

  public saveCustomer(customer: Customer) {
    this.logger.log(`Saving customer: ${customer.name}`);
    // Save the customer to the database
  }
}

// Logger service
class Logger {
  public log(message: string) {
    console.log(message);
  }
}

// Customer class
class Customer {
  public name: string;
}

// Create an instance of the CustomerService and inject the Logger service
const customerService = new CustomerService(new Logger());

// Use the customer service to save a customer
const customer = new Customer();
customer.name = 'John Doe';
customerService.saveCustomer(customer);

```
In this example, the CustomerService class depends on the Logger service to log messages. When an instance of CustomerService is created, it is provided with an instance of Logger through the constructor. This allows the CustomerService to use the Logger to log messages without having to create the Logger itself. This makes the code more flexible and easier to test, as the CustomerService can be provided with a mock Logger when it is being tested.


## Example DI Container
Here is an example of how a dependency injection (DI) container can be used in a TypeScript application:

```
// CustomerService depends on the Logger service
class CustomerService {
  constructor(private logger: Logger) {}

  public saveCustomer(customer: Customer) {
    this.logger.log(`Saving customer: ${customer.name}`);
    // Save the customer to the database
  }
}

// Logger service
class Logger {
  public log(message: string) {
    console.log(message);
  }
}

// Customer class
class Customer {
  public name: string;
}

// Create a DI container and register the Logger service
const container = new Container();
container.register(Logger);

// Use the container to create an instance of the CustomerService and
// inject the Logger service
const customerService = container.resolve(CustomerService);

// Use the customer service to save a customer
const customer = new Customer();
customer.name = 'John Doe';
customerService.saveCustomer(customer);

```

In this example, the Container class is used to manage the dependencies between objects in the application. The Logger service is registered with the container, and the container is then used to create an instance of the CustomerService. The container automatically injects the Logger service into the CustomerService when it is created, allowing the CustomerService to use the Logger without having to create it itself. This makes the code more flexible and easier to test, as the Logger can be swapped out with a mock implementation when the CustomerService is being tested.

### Container Class
In the example you provided, the Container class is not a built-in class from TypeScript or any other programming language. It is a custom class that is implemented as part of the dependency injection (DI) container used in the example. DI containers are typically implemented as custom classes that manage the dependencies between objects in a software application.

In the example, the Container class is used to register the different services and classes that make up the application, and to create and manage the objects that use those services and classes. It is responsible for injecting the necessary dependencies into each object as it is created, allowing the objects to work together seamlessly.

The specific implementation of the Container class will vary depending on the needs of the application and the design of the DI container. In the example you provided, the Container class is relatively simple and only has a few methods, but in a more complex application, the Container class may have many more methods and features to support the needs of the application.

 the Container class is a custom class that is used as part of a dependency injection (DI) container. DI containers are tools that help manage the dependencies and relationships between objects in software applications. They are commonly used in object-oriented programming to reduce the tight coupling between different parts of the code and improve the overall design and flexibility of the application.

The Container class in the example is responsible for managing the dependencies between the different services and classes in the application. It is configured with a set of rules that define the dependencies between the different objects, and it is responsible for creating and managing the objects that make up the application. The Container class also injects the necessary dependencies into each object as it is created, allowing the objects to work together seamlessly.

In the example you provided, the Container class has two main methods: register and resolve. The register method is used to register a service or class with the container, and the resolve method is used to create an instance of a registered service or class and inject its dependencies. These methods allow the Container to manage the dependencies between the different objects in the application and ensure that they can work together seamlessly.

the Container class can be implemented in TypeScript

``` 
class Container {
  // Map of registered services and classes
  private registeredServices: Map<any, any>;

  constructor() {
    this.registeredServices = new Map();
  }

  // Register a service or class with the container
  public register(service: any) {
    this.registeredServices.set(service, service);
  }

  // Create an instance of a registered service or class and inject its dependencies
  public resolve<T>(service: any): T {
    // Get the constructor function of the service
    const constructor = this.registeredServices.get(service);
    if (!constructor) {
      throw new Error(`Service not registered: ${service.name}`);
    }

    // Create an array of dependencies for the constructor
    const dependencies = this.getDependencies(constructor);

    // Create and return a new instance of the service, injecting the dependencies
    return new constructor(...dependencies);
  }

  // Get the dependencies for a constructor function
  private getDependencies(constructor: Function) {
    // Get the required dependencies from the constructor's parameter types
    const types = Reflect.getMetadata('design:paramtypes', constructor);
    if (!types || !types.length) {
      return [];
    }

    // Create an instance of each dependency and return as an array
    return types.map(type => this.resolve(type));
  }
}

```

This implementation of the Container class has three main methods: register, resolve, and getDependencies. The register method is used to register a service or class with the container, and the resolve method is used to create an instance of a registered service or class and inject its dependencies. The getDependencies method is used by the resolve method to get the dependencies for a constructor function and create instances of those dependencies.

To use the Container class, you can create an instance of the Container and register the services and classes that make up your application. Then, you can use the resolve method to create instances of your services and classes and have their dependencies automatically injected by the container. This allows the objects in your application to work together seamlessly and makes your code more flexible and easier to maintain.
